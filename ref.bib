We implement a systematic event study with the 58 largest publicly listed companies in the defense industry, over the time period 1995–2005. We first identify, for each firm, the statistically significant abnormal returns over the time period. Then, we look for information releases likely to cause such stock price movements. Most of the key drivers in the defense industry are the same as in other industries (key role of formal earnings announcements and analysts’ recommendations) but we also identify some specific features, in particular the influence of geopolitical events and the relevance and frequency of bids and contracts on stock prices. Finally, we examine the impact of the September 11 terrorist attacks on defense firms.}},

The framework includes both the strength and direction of the links in the network, allowing us to formally test for evidence on changes in the completeness of the network, for contagion effects, and for strengthening and weakening of the links in the network. We find evidence of all of these effects for 107 US dollar denominated CDS spreads over 2003–2014. We use the results to illustrate the change from a relatively robust network with some vulnerability to financial sector shocks in the pre-GFC period to a highly fragile network during the GFC and a subsequent return to greater robustness post-GFC where, despite the Greek and European debt crisis effects, fragility is similar when sourced from either financial sector or sovereign debt shocks.}},

In particular, we formulate and examine precise and separate measures of return spillovers and volatility spillovers. Our framework facilitates study of both non‐crisis and crisis episodes, including trends and bursts in spillovers; both turn out to be empirically important. In particular, in an analysis of 19 global equity markets from the early 1990s to the present, we find striking evidence of divergent behaviour in the dynamics of return spillovers vs. volatility spillovers: return spillovers display a gently increasing trend but no bursts, whereas volatility spillovers display no trend but clear bursts.}},

Building on these insights, we track daily time-varying connectedness of major US financial institutions’ stock return volatilities in recent years, with emphasis on the financial crisis of 2007–2008.}},

Episodes of bad contagion, especially those involving a large number of countries, are followed by a significant drop in international stock returns. This predictability pattern can be understood as an international transmission effect, as bad contagion only affects countries that did not experience tail events. In addition, the negative effect of bad contagion spills over to real growth, sovereign default risk, and financial stability indicators.}},

We show that idiosyncratic credit risk shocks propagate much more strongly in both tails than at the conditional mean or median. Furthermore, we develop a measure of the relative spillover intensity in the right and left tails of the conditional distribution that provides a timely aggregate measure of systemic financial fragility and that can be used for risk management and monitoring purposes.
