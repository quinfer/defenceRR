## Abstract {.unnumbered}

This paper analyses return and volatility spillovers among 21 global aerospace and defence (A&D) companies from six countries and three continents using quantile-based models and daily data from August 23, 2010, to July 1, 2022. The results show that both return and volatility spillovers vary over time, and those estimated at normal market conditions, intensify during COVID-19 and Russia-Ukraine war periods. Spillovers of returns estimated at lower and upper quantiles exceed those estimated at the middle quantile. Volatility spillover is extremely high at the upper quantile and exhibits low variability. Chinese defence stocks are segmented from the rest under normal return conditions and a moderate volatility state. In contrast, they are somewhat integrated under extreme return conditions and volatility states. Hence, Chinese defence stocks entail more diversification benefits under normal conditions than in bear or bull markets. Further analysis shows that geopolitical risk consistently plays a significant role in driving both returns and volatility spillovers, especially during the pandemic and war periods, without ignoring the role of macroeconomic and financial variables. These results have implications for investors concerned with stock portfolio management under various return and volatility conditions and for policymakers preoccupied with policy design under unstable periods

# Introduction

On 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, instigating a brutal war that has led to wide-scale devastation and the consequences of which will be felt far into the future. While the humanitarian effects are almost incomprehensible, this war has substantially affected the global economy, financial markets, commodity markets (notably energy and grain prices), and the fortunes of defence companies. There appears to be no end to the war, and spending on defence has experienced a notable increase globally, with global military expenditure surpassing US\$ 2.2 trillion for the first time in 2022. During that year, the United States (U.S.) had the highest military spending, with a total of US\$ 877 billion, followed by China with US\$ 292 billion, Russia with US\$ 86.0 billion, India with US\$ 81.0 billion, Saudi Arabia with US\$ 75.0 billion, the United Kingdom (U.K.) with US\$ 69.0 billion, Germany with US\$ 56.0 billion, and France with US\$ 54.0 billion.[^1]

[^1]: Data are according to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (<https://sipri.org/>)

This increase in defence spending has led to the global aerospace and defence (A&D) industry outperforming equity markets in terms of return. According to Refinitiv Eikon, on January 2022 the total return of the A&D industry equated to 13.89% YoY, compared to -3.45% YoY for global equity markets. This occurred even though the average total market capitalisation of A&D companies represents only 1% of worldwide equity markets. Furthermore, Refinitiv Eikon reported total revenues for 2022 were \$US 665 billion YoY for the A&D sector, with the top 21 largest companies (according to revenue) capturing 75% of this total revenue (See Appendix @tbl-A1 for detailed Market Analysis). Merger and acquisition activity in the A&D industry was also high, with 361 deals amounting to a total value, including net debt, of \$US 36 billion[^2]. Given the ongoing war and its effects, along with the recent market performance of many A&D companies, our study investigates the network topology of the return and volatility spillovers among major companies from the global A&D industry and the factors that drive these spillovers. Using a quantile-based approach to spillovers, we explicitly consider the transmission pathway of return and volatility from one company to another under various market return conditions and volatility states. Furthermore, we conduct multiple regressions to understand the role of geopolitical risk in driving return and volatility spillovers while considering various macroeconomic and financial variables.

[^2]: All market analysis was conducted using Refinitiv Eikon on February 22, 2023. The A&D sample consisted of 351 publicly listed securities with a total market capitalization of US\$ 1.37 trillion. The global equity market capitalisation at this time was US\$ 118 trillion.

Related literature on this topic remains relatively scarce, which is unsurprising given this is an ongoing conflict. Studies analyzing the A&D industry date back at least as far as the 1960s, mainly focusing on the investment quality of companies operating in this industry (Butler Jr, 1966b, 1966a, 1967) and their profits and market performance (Agapos and Gallaway, 1970; Suarez, 1976; Bohi, 1973). McDonald and Kendall (2011) study the effects of war on the U.S. defence industry, focusing on 16 firms that provided military equipment to the Department of Defence. Applying a cumulative prediction error (CPE) technique, they find that stock prices of defence firms tend to increase because of military actions. Capelle-Blancard and Couderc (2008) analyse the effect of media information on defence companies only, showing that news relating to earnings announcements and analyst recommendations are significant in explaining abnormal returns for these companies. Recently, Federle et al. (2022) analyse stock market responses to the war in Ukraine, finding that firms closer to Ukraine suffered from a relative proximity penalty, experiencing negative equity returns during the four weeks surrounding the beginning of the war. Le et al. (2023) use war-related news articles to investigate the market response of some companies to the war in Ukraine, showing a negative impact on airline stocks and a positive impact on defence stocks. Zhang et al. (2022) consider the co-movements between geopolitical risk and the returns and volatility of global aerospace and defence companies, indicating significant co-movements around the onset of the war in Ukraine. This is labelled a 'flight-to-arms' phenomenon, with co-movement found to be significant for many European and U.S. companies in the sample.

This paper contributes to the above body of literature by analysing the network of returns and volatility spillovers across major A&D companies using a quantile-based connectedness method and analyzing drivers of spillovers. First, the flexibility of this connectedness approach enables us to account for various market return conditions and volatility states. This is an important feature as previous findings highlight the importance of considering the sign of return shocks and size of volatility shocks when studying the spillover effects in financial markets (see, Bouri et al., 2020; Chatziantoniou et al., 2021; iq et al., 2021; Iqbal et al., 2022). This should add to Zhang et al. (2022) and Le et al. (2023), that consider only mean-based models. Second, our sample of 21 A&D companies incorporates eight out of the ten most significant in the world by revenue and covers six countries, namely the U.S., the U.K., France, Germany, China and Singapore, across three continents (North America, Europe, and Asia) over the period August 23, 2010 to July 1, 2022. The sample period covers events such as the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014, the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, and the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022, thus enabling the identification of significant spillovers across a varying set of global turbulent market conditions and geopolitical events. Third, analysing the factors driving the return and volatility spillovers across various market conditions constitutes another contribution to the literature on A&D companies (Federle et al., 2022; Le et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2022). Specifically, it illustrates the importance of geopolitical risk in increasing the spillover effect of both returns and volatility while accounting for the significance of macroeconomic and financial variables.

The main results show intensified spillover effects for stock returns and volatility under extreme market conditions and evidence of time evolution in spillovers, particularly for lower and upper tails returns. This suggests that the system of spillovers under extreme market conditions, irrespective of whether it is a bull or bear market, is unstable. Thus, it should be carefully monitored, given its potential consequences on portfolio and risk management in the A&D industry. An additional analysis analysing the drivers of spillovers with multiple regressions shows the impact of heightened geopolitical risk around the Russian-Ukraine war period on the return and volatility spillovers across A&D companies in most of the quantiles considered. Furthermore, the level of returns and volatility spillovers is also driven by macroeconomic and financial variables such as corporate credit conditions, stock market volatility, short-term liquidity risk, and real-time US business conditions ( measured using the Aruoba et al., 2009 methodology). Therefore, participants in the A&D industry, especially in the U.S. and Europe, should closely monitor the global geopolitical environment given its significant impact on the dynamics of information transmission in the A&D industry and, thus, the integration of A&D stocks and possibilities of diversification. The findings also highlight the tail risk propagation within the network system of aerospace and defence stocks, which should concern risk managers and policymakers.

The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the dataset. Section 3 provides a quantile-based spillover approach. Section 4 presents and discusses the results. Section 5 concludes.

# Data

Our dataset comprises daily closing prices of 21 global aerospace and defence companies in six countries (U.S., U.K., France, Germany, China, Singapore) across three continents (North America, Europe, and Asia) from August 23, 2010 to July 1, 2022. The selected companies are chosen to be large and liquid, with an individual market capitalisation exceeding US\$ 8 Billion. The list of companies is provided in Appendix @tbl-A1. According to the Refinitiv, our sample captures 72% of the total market capitalisation of the global A&D industry[^3]. The sample period is selected according to the availability of A&D stock price data from Refinitiv, especially for the Chinese Aecc Aviation Power 'A' because it exhibited many zero price fluctuations before the start of the sample period.

[^3]: At the time of writing, the Refinitiv Eikon database valued the market capitalisation of the Aerospace and Defence industry at \$US1.37 trillion.

Appendix Figure A1 plots the price series and highlights the country of incorporation. Furthermore, Appendix Figure A2 and Figure A3 display the log-return and volatility[^4] series, respectively. The price series reveal several distinct groupings in their movements. For many cases, prices in Figure A1 show common movement with a regime shift towards higher prices and more considerable volatility around 2020. Notably, Chinese stocks experienced a shock in 2016 of a similar magnitude to that of 2020. In July 2016, it was reported that China had performed a week of military drills in the South China Sea amid legal debates regarding its territorial claims to regional areas, which could account for this increase in volatility. In Figure A2, there is a large variability in the returns that coincides with the peak of COVID-19 in 2020 and the onset of the Russia-Ukraine war in early 2022, especially for most U.S.-European A&D stocks. Based on Figure A3, it is clear that the volatility of some A&D companies, such as Boeing, Transdigm, Safran, and Rolls-Royce Holdings experienced a spike around the pandemic outbreak and the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine war.

[^4]: Daily volatility is calculated as the squared of daily log-returns (Zhang et al., 2022).

Appendix Figure A2 plots the price series levels and highlights the country of incorporation. Furthermore, Appendix Figure A3 and Figure A4 display the log-return and volatility series, respectively. The price series levels reveal several distinct groupings in their movements. For many cases, price series levels in Figure A2 show common movement with a regime shift towards higher prices and larger volatility around 2020. Notably, Chinese stocks experienced a shock in 2016 of a similar magnitude to that of 2020. In July 2016, it was reported that China had performed a week of military drills in the South China Sea amid legal debates regarding its territorial claims to regional areas, which could account for this increase in volatility. In Figure A3, we notice a large variability in the returns around the peak of COVID-19 in 2020 and the Russia-Ukraine war in early 2022, especially for most US-European A&D stocks. Based on Figure A4, we observe that the volatility of some A&D companies such as Boeing, Transdigm, Safran, and Rolls-Royce Holdings experienced a spike around the pandemic outbreak and the Russia-Ukraine war.

Appendix @tbl-A2 and @tbl-A3 present summary statistics for daily returns and volatility series. Notably, Table 7 illustrates that the distributions of the daily returns series are mostly skewed to the left and exhibit fat "tailedness", with Airbus, Boeing, Rolls-Royce Holdings, Safran, and Transdigm experiencing the highest daily standard deviations. These companies are either directly in the aviation industry or supply to it. For example, Rolls-Royce supplies the Trent engine to Airbus. In this regard, airlines were hit particularly hard during the COVID-19 pandemic, with an estimated economic loss of US\$168 billion in 2020 [@bouwer2022], which may be a factor in the observed volatility. All return series are stationary, as shown by the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and Phillips-Perron (PP) test statistics. The same is true for the volatility series, as reported in Appendix @tbl-A3

Furthermore, we consider extreme volatility events, which coincide with the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak and indicate in Table 1 that the most volatile A&D stock is Rolls Royce Holdings. The company reported a loss of £4 billion for 2020, which led to a need to raise £7.3 billion in debt and equity and cut almost one-fifth of its workforce [@sillars2021]. Unsurprisingly, @tbl-Xtremes indicates that the five highest daily volatility scores mainly occur around the end of March 2020 at the height of the uncertainty during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

# Methodology

The nature and strength of spillovers across financial markets have traditionally been measured using conventional mean estimators such as the connectedness approach of Diebold and Yılmaz (2014). Interestingly, @Ando.2022 argue that systemic shocks are likely to be much larger than average shocks and that extreme negative return (or low volatility) shocks do not necessarily propagate in the same way as extreme positive return (or high volatility) shocks. Therefore, quantile-based estimators allow for identifying whether the spillover effects' topology changes with the shock distribution's size and sign as captured by the various quantiles of the shock distribution [@Bouri.2020].

To study the return and volatility connectedness across 21 global aerospace and defence companies, we use the quantile-VAR-based connectedness approach following Ando et al. (2022)[^5]. This approach extends the mean-based connectedness approach of Diebold and Yılmaz (2014) and thus allows for capturing the extreme connectedness estimated at the lower, middle, and upper quantiles. For returns, this helps obtain the connectedness of return shocks in bear, normal, and bull markets. For volatility, it helps capture the connectedness of volatility shocks in low, middle, and high volatility states.

[^5]: Existing studies in the Deibold-Yilmaz network literature use windows ranging from 100-250 days. Sensitivity analysis has been done and available upon request.

We consider a portfolio enivroment, where stocks are indexed i=1,2,...,N, and time periods are indexed t=1,2,...,T. Based on a quantile regression (Koenker, 2005), we consider a quantile-VAR process of p^th^ order for a set of N return (volatility) series for time T, $y_{it}=\{y_{t=1,i=1},\dots,y_{t=T,i=N}\}$ , as given by:

$$
y_{t}=c_{i(\tau)}+\sum_{j=1}^{p} B_{j,(\tau)} y_{t-j}+e_{t(\tau)}, t=1,\dots,T
$$ {#eq-one}

where, $c_{(\tau)}$ denotes a vector of constant terms at quantile $\tau$, $B_{j(\tau)}$ represents the matrix of the j^th^ lagged coefficients of the dependent variable at quantile $\tau$, with i =1,..., p, and $e_{t(\tau)}$ denotes a vector of error terms at quantile $\tau$. @eq-one is estimated by assuming that the error terms conform to the population quantile restriction, $Q_t(e_{t(\tau)} |y_{t=1},\dots,y_{t=p})=0$ .

We express the $\tau^{th}$ conditional quantile of response y as:

$$
Q_t(y_t |y_{t=1},\dots,y_{t=p})=c_{(\tau)}+\hat{B_{i(\tau)}} y_{t-i}
$$ {#eq-two}

Following the approach of @Diebold.2014 , we compute return and volatility connectedness measures based on a quantile variance decomposition.

We represent @eq-two as an infinite order vector moving average process:

$$
y_t=\mu_{(\tau)}+\sum_{s=0}^{\infty}A_{s(\tau)}e_{t-s(\tau)}, t=1,\dots.T
$$ {#eq-three}

where,

```{=tex}
\begin{align*}
\mu{(\tau)}= \frac{c_{\tau}}{\left (I_n-B_{1(\tau)}-\dots-B_{p(\tau)} \right)} \\
A_{s(\tau)}= \begin{cases} 0, s<0 \\ I_n, s=0 \\ B_{1(\tau)}A_{s-1(\tau)}+\dots+B_{p(\tau)}A_{s-p(\tau)}, s>0 \end{cases} \\
\text{and $y_t$ is given by the sum of $e_{t(\tau)}$}
\end{align*}
```
The generalized forecast error variance decomposition (GFEVD),$\theta^h_{i,j}$, is computed as in @Diebold.2014. The GFEVD reflects the contribution of the i^th^ stock return (volatility) to the variance of the forecast error of the stock return (volatility) i^th^ at h-steps ahead and is defined as:

$$
\theta^{(h)}_{j \leftarrow i,(\tau)}= \frac{\sigma_{ii}^{-1}\sum_{l=0}^{h}(e_j^{'}h_h \Omega_{(\tau)} e_j)^2}{\sum_{h=0}^{H-1}(e_i^{'}h_h \Omega_{(\tau)} e_i)}
$$ {#eq-four}

where, V is the variance matrix of the vector of residuals, $\sigma_{ii}$ is the j^th^ diagonal element of the V matrix, and $e_i$denotes a vector with a value of 1 for the i^th^ element and 0 otherwise.

Its scaled version,$\theta_{j\leftarrow i,(\tau)}^h$ , is represented as:

$$
\theta_{j\leftarrow i,(\tau)}^h=\frac{\theta^{(h)}_{j \leftarrow i,(\tau)}}{\sum_{j=1}^N \theta^{(h)}_{j \leftarrow i,(\tau)}}
$$ {#eq-five}

The scaled version measures the spillover of the idiosyncratic shock affecting variable i onto variable j [@Ando.2022].

Various spillover measures are estimated at each quantile and are summarised in Table 2. The third column, "Description", describes how these can be interpreted in terms of the system of spillovers. Note that, by construction, own share and FROM sum to one for i=1,2,..,m; however, TO can take values bigger than or less than one.

The lag order of the quantile VARs is selected based on SIC. It equals 1 for the quantile-VAR of the return series and 2 for the quantile-VAR of the volatility series. As for the forecast horizon (H), we use ten days. Furthermore, we conduct a time-varying spillover analysis (Diebold & Yilmaz, 2014) based on a rolling window of 200 days. To assess the robustness of our results, we use a fixed window length of 200 days and a 5-step forecast horizon and show that our spillover results remain almost the same, suggesting their robustness to the window size and forecast horizon. These results are not reported here but are available on request from the authors.

# Results

In the context of global defence stocks, we are primarily interested in the spillover effects due to crisis periods and conflict events, particularly relevant in the current geopolitical climate. Regarding financial risk management, the propagation of idiosyncratic risk contagion is often defined as the difference in how the shock propagates during extreme events relative to normal times [@Londono.2019]. Our analysis thus attempts to investigate how much of the uncertainty associated with A&D stocks can be attributed to the idiosyncratic shocks coming from these stocks as the shock size varies.

We present the return and volatility spillovers across the 21 A&D stocks under study. The sample period of August 23, 2010 - July 1, 2022, covers normal and extreme market conditions, including the COVID-19 outbreak and the Russia-Ukraine war.

## Network topology of return and volatility spillovers

To understand the aggregate spillover intensity among A&D stocks, we visualise the results of a full-sample analysis for both returns and volatility at the median, 5th and 95th percentile. The network visualisation reflects the strength of the bilateral spillovers by the relative thickness of the edges. At the same time, the size of each node is proportional to the square root of the total spillover (inwards and outwards) [@Ando.2022]. Furthermore, the country of origin of the company is represented by colour.

### Return spillovers

@fig-rtn illustrates the network visualisation of the bilateral spillover effects of the 21 return series, whereas @fig-vol displays the exact visualisation for the 21 volatility series. Some similar patterns emerge, notably the consistent size of all stock nodes representing the significant aggregate spillover effects in both directions for median and extreme upper quantiles. However, there are also some crucial differences. Firstly, the most substantial individual pairwise spillover effects are observed at the median conditional distribution, primarily within countries. Notably, Chinese stocks show the most robust linkages within the country but the weakest linkages outside their country of origin. This corresponds to literature relating to general stock market trends observed in China; for example, Valukonis (2014) finds that following the recovery from the financial crisis of 2008, Chinese and US stock market indices display a weak correlation which is perhaps due to Chinese markets being somewhat isolated from global markets and not as influenced by globalisation as other markets may be.

In contrast, all pairwise spillover effects are weaker at the extremes of the return distribution. This finding is consistent with previous studies, which show that in times of stress, the network is characterised by a more significant number of weaker bilateral linkages increasing the weight completeness of the network (Dungey et al., 2019; Ando et al., 2022). In our context, this would mean that while shock spillovers between individual stock pairs are small, the overall connectedness of the system is increasing in extreme bull (the extreme upper quantile illustrated by @fig-rtn95) and bear (the extreme lower quantile illustrated by @fig-rtn5) markets, meaning that the shock propagation is higher under extreme return conditions. Furthermore, unlike bull market conditions, aggregate spillover effects (represented by node size) are smaller in bear market conditions, although US stock have more influence than countries.

### Volatility spillovers

Moving to the network of volatility spillovers, @fig-vol exhibits a similar pattern to those for the return spillovers. Weak bilateral spillovers characterise the extreme upper quantile, and the strongest pairwise spillovers occur at the median quantile. Again, we observe the most robust volatility linkages between Chinese companies, followed by volatility linkages between US companies. Strong volatility linkages between Chinese companies are also apparent at the extreme lower quantile. Huang et al. (2021) constructed a tail risk spillover network for China's industry sectors. They showed that the national defence sector is defined as a 'downstream' sector due to its position in the industrial chain. It is found that it has relatively high volatility compared to other leading industries. Bu et al. (2019) analysed movement in the Chinese stock market using a causal network method, finding that investors are concerned with risk and return in normal periods but are only concerned about risk in crisis periods. Furthermore, we observe similar differences between low and high volatility market conditions in terms of the aggregate spillover effect sizes and distributional differences.

## Time varying spillover results

So far, we have analysed measures of connectedness for the entire sample using the network topology visualisation. However, it is essential to illustrate meaningful time variation in the returns and volatility spillover effects of A&D stocks under various market conditions. Furthermore, bilateral spillover of idiosyncratic risk seems stronger for both returns and volatility series, which reflect the interconnectedness across A&D stocks. However, it is important to note that restricting the network analysis to the middle of the distribution will not capture the full extent of dependence when large negative return and large positive return shocks occur (i.e.under extreme market conditions and events) as well as very low and very high volatility shocks manifest. Therefore, in this section, we conduct a rolling analysis with a quantile VAR to capture the time variability in the return and volatility spillovers in normal times (i.e.at the median of the conditional distribution) and abnormal market conditions (i.e. atthe upper and lower tails of the conditional distribution). We use a fixed window length of 200[^6] days and a 10-step forecast horizon. This will provide a comprehensive analysis of connectedness at the center and in the left and right tail dependence. This is conducted for both returns and volatility.

[^6]: Existing studies in the Deibold-Yilmaz network literature use windows ranging from 100-250 days. Sensitivity analysis has been done and available upon request.

The TOTAL connectedness index at the conditional median (a measure of the average connectedness) and extremes for returns and volatility systems are presented in @fig-TCI50. In normal conditions the connectedness in the returns system tends to be larger than that of the volatility system of defense stocks. The connectedness reaches its peak at point h (the 'dash for cash' event) at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, while the connectedness levels are greater in the returns system the volatility system connectedness exhibits higher sensitivity to shocks, with the largest regime shift at point h.

@fig-TCI5 and @fig-TCI95 illustrate the time variation of total system connectivity at the 5th and 95th percentiles of the conditional distributions. It is noted that return system connectedness is persistently high (above 90) at both tails of the conditional distribution, while volatility system connectedness in period of extremely low volatility (5th percentile) is more sensitivity temporal events.

In the spirit of Ando et al. (2022), we illustrate in @fig-TCIrtd the relative tail dependence (RTD) calculated as the difference between the 95th and 5th percentile for both returns and volatility spillovers. Positive (negative) values of RTD indicate stronger (weaker) dependence in the right tail compared to the left tail. For returns, we interpret increases (decreases) in RTD as evidence of a rising (falling) connectedness of the financial performance of defence stocks. For volatility, we interpret increases (decreases) in RTD as evidence of rising (falling) connectedness of financial uncertainty in defence stocks, or more succinctly, rising (falling) financial fragility as positive (negative) volatility shocks disseminate through the system of defence stocks.

Starting with the illustration of the RTD of the return spillovers, the upper panel of @fig-TCIrtd shows a time variation of the RTD for return spillovers and evidence of asymmetric effect over the period, indicative of non-equally spread of positive and negative feedback loops in return spillover effects. Moving to the lower panel of @fig-TCIrtd, we notice the persistent one-sidedness of the RTD for the volatility series, with the right tail of the condition distribution dominant throughout the period. This asymmetry suggests that the size of that uncertainty amplifies volatility spillovers across the defence. These results suggest that the total connectedness across the shocks of A&D stocks is affected by the sign of returns and the size of the volatility in the system.

Furthermore, we consider the chronological order of prominent global economic and conflict turmoil events in the context of median and extreme spillovers in volatility and return shocks. Some striking patterns emerge in this chronological order. From the beginning of the conflict in Crimea (a + b) to the Brexit referendum (d), the RTD for volatility trends down, which is indicative of an increase in resilience (reduction in fragility) in the system of A&D stocks. This is coupled with the fact that RTD is primarily positive for the return system in this sub-period. This finding suggests that upper tail returns (right tail of the conditional distribution) in this period induce some spillover effects while the financial fragility of the system weakens. There is also a notable regime shift at the dash for cash date (h), where the financial fragility (the volatility system) fell by 50% (TCI = 40 to TCI = 20).

### Individual connectivity

To disentangle the total connectedness variation further explore the net spillover effects $T_{\cdot \leftarrow i,(\tau)}^h -F_{i \leftarrow \cdot,(\tau)}^h$. Figure \ref{fig:netrtn50}, Figure \ref{fig:netrtn95}, and Figure \ref{fig:netrtnfive} present the Net spillover of individual stock returns at the median, upper and lower quantiles. Figure \ref{fig:volnet50}, Figure \ref{fig:volnet95}, and Figure \ref{fig:volnet5} presents the same estimates for stock volatilities.

\end{sidewaysfigure}
```
We group these plots by country, and some interesting patterns emerge. Firstly, at the median of distributions, the three Chinese defence stocks are net spillover receivers in both their return performance and volatility. This may indicate the need for global maturity in these stocks compared to the other members of the system belonging to developed markets (e.g., the US and Europe). Secondly, the US A&D stocks dominate the sample and are net transmitters of both volatility and return spillover effects. More precisely, in normal periods (i.e.the median of the conditional distribution), Raytheon Technologies and General Dynamics are dominant net transmitters. This pattern also replicates at the extremes of the conditional distributions. While this is unsurprising given that Raytheon Technologies is the largest global defence stock, it is worth noting that General Dynamics is the sixth largest. For the latter, the result can be driven by some sizeable recent defence contracts signed, for example, the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency in March 2022 (US\$4.5 billion), the US Navy in August 2022 (US\$1.4 billion) and the US Army in 2022 (US\$1.2 billion). Compared to the system of returns, the system of volatilities exhibits much more time variation, perhaps indicative of the high sensitivity to market fluctuations of financial risk.

In terms of the prominent dates in Figure \ref{fig:volnet50}, Figure \ref{fig:volnet95}, and Figure \ref{fig:volnet5} there are notable positive spikes at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic with the largest appearing in the median of the conditional distribution of the volatility system. The largest of these are in Raytheon Technologies and Howmet Aerospace, which both spike at over 200 in net transmission terms. Within the US stocks, Raytheon and General Dynamics are the most transmitive in both their median and extreme spillover effects. Finally, in terms of magnitude, Singapore technology engineering, are the largest receiver of spillover effects at both the median and the extremes, which is not surprising given their small market capitalization compared to the others (see @tbl-A1 for details of size of stocks).

Compared to previous studies, our above findings reveal that both return and volatility spillovers are unstable over time, and those estimated at normal market conditions (at the middle quantile), intensify during crisis periods such as the COVID-19 outbreak. There is also evidence of intensified spillover effects for return shocks at both lower and upper quantiles, exceeding the return spillover effects estimated at the middle quantile, thus indicating significantly different behaviour of spillovers across different market conditions. The level of spillovers at the lower quantile in the return system is considerably larger than that in the volatility system. However, the level of volatility spillover is exceptionally high at the upper quantile only and exhibits a low variability. Finally, Chinese defence stocks seem segmented from the rest under normal return conditions and a moderate volatility state. However, they somewhat integrated with global defence stocks under extreme return conditions and volatility states. This implies that Chinese defence stocks entail more diversification benefits under normal conditions than bear or bull markets when returns and volatility are very low or high.

## Drivers of return and spillovers -- the role of geopolitical risk

In this section, we provide insights into the main drivers of return and volatility spillovers across A&D stocks while paying particular attention to the impact of geopolitical risk. The explanatory variables considered in the analysis, selected based on previous studies, are:

-   The geopolitical risk (GPR) index of Caldara and Iacoviello (2022), which is constructed based on press articles covering 11 leading international newspapers, and defined as "the kind of risk related to events such as wars, terrorist acts and political tensions, that can affect the normal and peaceful process of international relations" (Caldara and Iacoviello, 2022)[^7];
-   An interaction of GPR with the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian-Ukraine war (), where is a dummy variable taking the value of 1 during the COVID-19 outbreak and war period (January 02, 2020-- July 01, 2022) and 0 otherwise;
-   The US economic policy uncertainty (US EPU) index of Baker et al. (2016), constructed based on US newspaper articles reflecting uncertainties in US economic policies;
-   The CBOE VIX index, which captures the 30-day expected volatility of the US stock market and is often used a proxy of fear among investors, not only in the US but across the global stock markets;
-   The log returns on the S&P 500 Composite Index, which is used as a proxy for the performance of the global stock markets;
-   The US Treasury spread, computed as "10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Minus 2-Year Treasury Constant Maturity", which reflects the shape of the US yield curve;
-   The TED spread, computed as the 3-month LIBOR USD rate minus the 3-month US Treasury Bill rate, which captures short-term liquidity risk;
-   Default spread, computed as the yield on Moody's BAA-rated bonds minus the yield on AAA-rated corporate bonds, reflecting corporate credit conditions;
-   US business conditions, measured by the Aruoba-Diebold-Scotti (ADS) index of Aruoba et al. (2009), which measures real business conditions on a daily basis;
-   The US inflation expectation, as measured by the 5-Year Breakeven Inflation Rate (T5YIE);

Starting with the drivers of the TCI of returns, @tbl-reg1 shows that many of the estimated coefficients of explanatory variables are not necessarily the same across the middle and upper/lower quantile spillovers. However, the GPR index is a significant driver of return spillovers at all quantiles, and its effect is positive and significant for all cases after controlling for the COVID-19 outbreak period, which includes the Russian-Ukraine war sub-period. This suggests that the heightened level of geopolitical risk around the war period has led to increased return spillovers across A&D stocks. Regarding the control variables, we notice that S&P500 returns, VIX, default spread, and business conditions positively impact return spillovers, irrespective of the quantile, bearing in mind that their magnitude is the largest at the middle quantile. @tbl-reg2 considers the results on the drivers of volatility spillovers. The results point to the exact impact of GPR on volatility spillovers, especially when the interaction term is considered, except at the upper quantile. Among the other explanatory variables, we highlight the significant role played by corporate credit conditions, stock market volatility, short-term liquidity risk, and real-time business conditions.

Furthermore, we conduct a robustness analysis using the GPRACT sub-index instead of the GPR index while estimating Equation (6). Given that our analysis covers the war in Ukraine period, the use of the GPRACT dimension of the GPR index is very crucial because it reflects the realization of adverse events and war-related events and military acts unlike the GPRTHREAT dimension which only reflects geopolitical tensions and military threats [@caldara2022measuring] . The results from the re-estimation of Equation (6) using GPRACT instead of GPR are presented in Appendix Tables A4 and A5. They are quite similar to those reported in Tables 4 and 5, which confirms the role of geopolitical risks in driving the spillovers of returns and volatility among A&D stocks and thus the robustness of our results to the choice of the proxy of geopolitical risk.

# Conclusion

This study analyses the return and volatility connectedness of a sample of major A&D stocks in normal and extreme market periods using a quantile-based VAR approach of connectedness, which captures the system of connectedness at lower, middle, and upper parts of the conditional distribution of both returns and volatility. Then, the drivers of the connectedness index estimated across various quantiles are revealed, notably the geopolitical risk index.

The main results suggest evidence of variation in the quantile structure of the system of connectedness among major A&D stocks. The network topology analysis shows that shocks propagate more strongly at both lower and upper tails of the conditional distribution than at the conditional median, suggesting that the structure of spillovers at both tails is dissimilar to that observed at the conditional median. However, the magnitude of bilateral connections is smaller at the tails than at the median, but they are more apparent. In the latter, connectedness is stronger within countries, but the volatility and return systems are less connected overall. Finally, we find that shocks are smaller and disproportionately larger in US stocks when comparing bear market and bull market conditions. These results suggest that the evolution of the dependence structure at the tails is notable and should not be overlooked. In other words, the system-wide connectedness of shocks in the A&D industry can be masked when connectedness measures are estimated at the conditional median or mean, thus missing a significant portion of the spillover information related to extraordinarily negative and positive shocks and extremely low and high volatility states. Accordingly, applying quantile-based models of connectedness is recommended as a natural extension to the pervasive average-based models. This finding result matters for asset pricing and allocation under various market conditions.

The application of a time-varying analysis shows that the degree of tail-dependence varies with time and intensifies during periods of economic and geopolitical-conflict turmoil. Intuitively, the main findings generally concord with the literature on the return and volatility spillovers under various market conditions in the global stock markets, which reflect the nature of A&D stocks despite their price outperformance during periods of intensified geopolitical risk. Furthermore, the relative tail dependence calculation indicates an asymmetry between the behaviour of return (volatility) spillovers in lower and upper quantiles. The findings on the extreme connectedness at upper and lower tails offer a nuanced view of the importance of tail risk propagation within the network system of A&D stocks, which points to the utility of adopting quantile-based methods of spillovers to differentiate between the networks of spillovers under various market conditions. This might concern the supervision of risk under extreme market conditions. In fact, by extending our knowledge regarding the effects of the size and sign of the spillovers on the system of connectedness among significant A&D stocks, policymakers can use appropriate policy tools and surveillance mechanisms to manage potential adversative impacts from extreme risk spillovers in the A&D industry.

Additional analysis reveals the importance of geopolitical risk at the end of the sample period in driving the spillovers of both returns and volatility without underestimating the significant role played by some macroeconomic and financial variables. Therefore, market participants should closely examine the geopolitical risk levels for making inferences on market integration in the aerospace and defence industry and the diversification possibilities across various market conditions.

Our analysis is not free of limitations. Given that the GPR index and its sub-indices are text-based indices,newspaper articles generally follow events; therefore, the stock markets, especially in developed economies, respond much quicker to (geopolitical) events than newspapers. This would lead to possible endogeneity issues with the GPR\[\^10\], which require more a refined consideration and analysis that shouldbe the subject of future related studies.
