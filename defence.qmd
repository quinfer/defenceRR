## Abstract {.unnumbered}
This paper analyses return and volatility spillovers among 21 global aerospace and defence (A&D) companies from six countries and three continents using quantile-based models and daily data from August 23, 2010, to July 1, 2022. The results show that both return and volatility spillovers vary over time, and those estimated at normal market conditions, intensify during COVID-19 and Russia-Ukraine war periods. Spillovers of returns estimated at lower and upper quantiles exceed those estimated at the middle quantile. Volatility spillover is extremely high at the upper quantile and exhibits low variability. Chinese defence stocks are segmented from the rest under normal return conditions and a moderate volatility state. In contrast, they are somewhat integrated under extreme return conditions and volatility states. Hence, Chinese defence stocks entail more diversification benefits under normal conditions than in bear or bull markets. Further analysis shows that geopolitical risk consistently plays a significant role in driving both returns and volatility spillovers, especially during the pandemic and war periods, without ignoring the role of macroeconomic and financial variables. These results have implications for investors concerned with stock portfolio management under various return and volatility conditions and for policymakers preoccupied with policy design under unstable periods

# Introduction

On 24 February 2022, the mounting tension between Russia and Ukraine peaked, instigating a brutal war that has led to wide-scale devastation, especially in Europe, the consequences of which will be felt far into the future. While the humanitarian effects are almost incomprehensible, this destructive war has substantially affected the commodity markets, notably energy and grain prices, the global economy, the financial markets, and the fortunes of defence companies. There appears to be no end to the war, and the spending on defence has experienced a notable increase globally. In 2022, global military expenditure surpassed $US 2.2 trillion for the first time. Large increases in military spending are noticed in Europe in response to the Russia-Ukraine war. To top the chart, the United States (US) spent the most on military spending ($US 877 billion), followed by China ($US 292 billion), Russia ($US 86.0 billion), India ($US 81.0 billion), Saudi Arabia ($US 75.0 billion), the United Kingdom (UK) ($US 69.0 billion), Germany ($US 56.0 billion), and France (($US 54.0 billion)

On 24 February 2022, Russia attacked Ukraine, initiating a war that has led to wide scale devastation, especially in Europe, the consequences of which will be felt far into the future. While the humanitarian effects are almost incomprehensible, this destructive event has also substantially affected financial markets, the global economy, energy and grain prices, and the fortunes of defense companies. There unfortunately appears to be no end in sight for the war and increases in spending on defense continued to increase globally. In 2022 global military expenditure surpassed \$US 2 trillion for the first time ([World military expenditure passes \$2 trillion for first time according to SIPRI](https://www.sipri.org/media/press-release/2022/world-military-expenditure-passes-2-trillion-first-time)). During the same year, the United States (US) spent the most on military spending (\$US 750 billion), followed by China (\$US 237 billion), Saudi Arabia (\$US 67.6 billion), India (\$US 61 billion) and the United Kingdom (UK) (\$US 55.1 billion).[^1]

[^1]:Data are according to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (<https://sipri.org/>)

This defence spending has seen the global aerospace and defence (A&D) industry outperforms the equity markets. According to Refinitiv Eikon, for the year ending 31/12/2022, the total return of the A&D industry equated to 13.89%, compared to -3.45% for the global equity markets. This is even though the average total market capitalisation of A&D companies represents only 1% of the global equity markets. Total revenues of the year ending 31/12/2022 were \$US 665 billion[^2], with the top 21 largest companies by revenue capturing 75% of this total revenue (See Appendix Table A1 for detailed Market Analysis). Merger and acquisition activity in the A&D industry was also high, with 361 deals with a total value, including Net Debt, of \$US 36 billion. Given the Russia and Ukraine war and the outsize recent market performance of many A&D companies, our study investigates the network topology of the return and volatility spillovers among major companies from the global A&D industry and the factors that drive these spillovers. Using a quantile-based approach to spillovers, we explicitly consider the transmission pathway of return and volatility from one company to another under various market return conditions and volatility states. Furthermore, we conduct various regressions to understand the role of geopolitical risk in driving return and volatility spillovers while considering various macroeconomic and financial variables. 

[^2]: All market analysis was conducted using Refinitiv Eikon on 22/02/2023. The A&D sample consisted of 351 publicly listed securities with a total market capitalisation of \$1.37 trillion dollars. The global equity market capitalisation at this time was 118 trillion dollars.

Surprisingly, the related literature could be more extensive in this regard. Studies on the A&D industry date back at least as far as the 1960s, mainly focusing on the investment quality of companies in this industry (Butler Jr, 1966b, 1966a, 1967) and their profits and market performance (Agapos and Gallaway, 1970; Suarez, 1976; Bohi, 1973). McDonald and Kendall (2011) studied the effects of war on the U.S. defence industry, focusing on 16 firms that provided military equipment to the Department of Defence. Applying a cumulative prediction error (CPE) technique, they find that stock prices of defence firms tend to increase because of military actions. Capelle-Blancard and Couderc (2008) analyse the effect of media information on defence companies only, showing that news relating to earnings announcements and analyst recommendations are significant in explaining abnormal returns for these companies. Recently, Federle et al. (2022) analysed stock market responses to the war in Ukraine, finding that firms closer to Ukraine suffered from a relative proximity penalty, experiencing negative equity returns during the four weeks surrounding the beginning of the war. Le et al. (2023) use war-related news articles to investigate the market response of some companies to the war in Ukraine, showing a negative impact on airline stocks and a positive impact on defence stocks. Zhang et al. (2022) consider the co-movements between geopolitical risk and the returns and volatility of global aerospace and defence companies, indicating significant co-movements around the onset of the war in Ukraine. This is labelled a ‘flight-to-arms’ phenomenon, with co-movement found to be significant for many European and US companies in the sample. 
This paper contributes to the above body of literature by analysing the network of returns and volatility spillovers across major A&D companies, using a quantile-based connectedness, and covering the drivers of spillovers. First, the flexibility of this connectedness approach allows for accounting for various market return conditions and volatility states. This is an important feature as previous findings highlight the importance of considering the sign of return shocks and size of volatility shocks when studying the spillover effects in the financial markets (see, Bouri et al., 2020; Chatziantoniou et al., 2021; Saeed et al., 2021; Iqbal et al., 2022). This should add to Zhang et al. (2022) and Le et al. (2023), who consider only mean-based models. Second, our sample of 21 A&D companies incorporates eight out of the ten largest in the world by revenue and covers six countries, namely US, UK, France, Germany, China and Singapore, across three continents (North America, Europe, and Asia) over the period August 23, 2010 to July 1, 2022. The period under study covers important events such as the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014, the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, and the Russia-Ukraine in 2022, thus enabling the identification of significant spillovers across a varying set of global turbulent market conditions and geopolitical events. Third, analysing the factors driving the return and volatility spillovers across various market conditions constitutes another contribution to the literature on A&D companies (Federle et al., 2022; Le et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2022). Specifically, it shows the importance of geopolitical risk in driving up the spillover effect of both returns and volatility while accounting for the significance of macroeconomic and financial variables.
The main results on the spillover effects across various quantiles show intensified spillover effects for both stock returns and volatility under extreme market conditions and evidence of time evolution in the spillovers, especially for lower and upper tails returns. This suggests that the system of spillovers under extreme market conditions, irrespective of whether it is bull or bear market, is unstable. Thus, it should be carefully monitored, given its potential consequences on portfolio and risk management in the A&D industry. An additional analysis involving the drivers of spillovers shows the impact of heightened geopolitical risk around the Russian-Ukraine war period on the return and volatility spillovers across A&D companies in most of the quantiles considered. Furthermore, the level of returns and volatility spillovers is also driven by macroeconomic and financial variables such as corporate credit conditions, stock market volatility, short-term liquidity risk, and real business condition. Therefore, participants in the A&D industry, especially in the US and Europe, should closely examine the global geopolitical environment given its significant impact on the dynamics of information transmission in the A&D industry and, thus, the integration of A&D stocks and the possibilities of diversification. The findings also highlight the tail risk propagation within the network system of aerospace and defence stocks, which should concern risk managers and policymakers. 
The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the dataset. Section 3 provides a quantile-based spillover approach. Section 4 presents and discusses the results. Section 5 concludes. 

# Data

Our dataset comprises the daily closing prices of 21 global aerospace and defence companies in six countries (US, UK, France, Germany, China, Singapore) and three continents (North America, Europe, and Asia). The selected companies are chosen to be large and liquid, with an individual market capitalisation exceeding e billion USD. The list of 21 companies is provided in Appendix Table A1. Appendix Figure A1 shows the share our sample captures of the total market capitalisation of the global A&D industry, which represents `r round(100*sums$sum[2]/sum(sums$sum))` \%. The sample period (August 23, 2010 - July 1, 2022) is selected according to the availability of A&D stock price data from Refinitiv DataStream, especially for the Chinese Aecc Aviation Power 'A' because it exhibited many zero price fluctuations at the daily basis before the start of the sample period on 23 August 2010. 

Appendix Figure A2 plots the price series levels and highlights the country of incorporation. Furthermore,  Appendix Figure A3 and Figure A4 display the log-return and volatility series, respectively. The price series levels reveal several distinct groupings in their movements. For many cases, price series levels in Figure A2 show common movement with a regime shift towards higher prices and larger volatility around 2020. Notably, Chinese stocks experienced a shock in 2016 of a similar magnitude to that of 2020. In July 2016, it was reported that China had performed a week of military drills in the South China Sea amid legal debates regarding its territorial claims to regional areas, which could account for this increase in volatility. In Figure A3, we notice a large variability in the returns around the peak of COVID-19 in 2020 and the Russia-Ukraine war in early 2022, especially for most US-European A&D stocks. Based on Figure A4, we observe that the volatility of some A&D companies such as Boeing, Transdigm, Safran, and Rolls-Royce Holdings experienced a spike around the pandemic outbreak and the Russia-Ukraine war.

Appendix A2 and Table A3 present summary statistics for daily returns and volatility series, respectively. Notably, Table A2 shows that the distributions of the daily returns series are mostly skewed to the left and exhibit fat “tailedness”, with Airbus, Boeing, Rolls-Royce Holdings, Safran, and Transdigm experiencing the highest daily standard deviation. These companies are either directly in the aviation industry or supply to it, as Rolls-Royce supplies the Trent engine to Airbus. In this regard, airlines were hit particularly hard during the COVID-19 pandemic, with an estimated economic loss of US$168 billion in 2020 (COVID-19’s impact on the global aviation sector \| McKinsey)*LISA add ref please*, which may be a factor in the observed volatility. All return series are stationary, as shown by the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) and Phillips-Perron (PP) test statistics. The same is true for the volatility series, as reported in Appendix Table A3.

  kable_styling(latex_options="HOLD_position")
```

Furthermore, we consider extreme volatility events, which coincide with the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak and indicate in Table 1 that the most volatile A&D stock is Rolls Royce Holdings. The company reported a loss of £4 billion for 2020 and was forced to raise £7.3 billion in debt and equity and cut almost one-fifth of its workforce (COVID-19: Rolls-Royce blames the ‘severe impact’ of the pandemic as it dives to £4bn loss \| Business News \| Sky News)*LISA add ref please*. Unsurprisingly, @tbl-Xtremes indicates that the five highest daily volatility scores mainly occur around the end of March 2020 at the height of the uncertainty during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.

  rplot(print_cor = TRUE) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45,hjust = 1))
  
```

@fig-cor displays Pearson's pairwise linear correlation coefficients for the daily returns series. Unsurprisingly, the returns of many US and European A&D stocks are highly correlated, for example between Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin. Both firms are leading suppliers to the US defense department, and regularly win joint contracts for work. @fig-cor also reveals that the Chinese stocks are highly correlated with each other but uncorrelated with the firms incorporated in the US and Europe. This corresponds to literature relating to general stock market trends observed in China, for example @valukonis2014 finds that following recovery from the financial crisis of 2008 Chinese and US stock market indices display weak correlation which is perhaps due to Chinese markets being somewhat isolated from global markets and not as influenced by globalization as other markets may be.

## Methodology

The nature and strength of financial market linkages has traditionally been measured using conventional mean estimators. @Ando.2022 argue that systemic shocks are likely to be much larger than average shocks and that it need not be the case that large shocks propagate in the same way as smaller shocks. Therefore using quantile-based estimators can identify whether the topology of the network of spillovers changes with the size of the shocks that affect the system. To study the return and volatility connectedness across 21 global defence and aerospace firms, we use the quantile-VAR-based connectedness approach introduced by [@Ando.2022][^3]. This approach extends the mean-based connectedness framework [@Diebold.2009; @Diebold.2014] and thus allows for capturing extreme connectedness measures estimated at the lower, middle, and upper quantiles. For returns, this allows for capturing the connectedness of return shocks in bear, normal, and bull periods. For volatility, we capture connectedness of volatility shocks in low, middle, and high volatility states.

[^3]: The methodology has been used by Bouri et al. (2020), Chatziantoniou et al. (2021) and Saeed et al. (2021).

We consider a portfolio enivroment, where stocks are indexed i=1,2,...,N, and time periods are indexed t=1,2,...,T. Based on a quantile regression (Koenker, 2005), we consider a quantile-VAR process of p^th^ order for a set of N return (volatility) series for time T, $y_{it}=\{y_{t=1,i=1},\dots,y_{t=T,i=N}\}$ , as given by:

$$
y_{t}=c_{i(\tau)}+\sum_{j=1}^{p} B_{j,(\tau)} y_{t-j}+e_{t(\tau)}, t=1,\dots,T
$$

where, $c_{(\tau)}$ denotes a vector of constant terms at quantile τ, $B_{j(\tau)}$ represents the matrix of the j^th^ lagged coefficients of the dependent variable at quantile τ, with i =1,..., p, and $e_{t(\tau)}$ denotes a vector of error terms at quantile τ. Equation (1) is estimated by assuming that the error terms conform to the population quantile restriction, $Q_t(e_{t(\tau)} |y_{t=1},\dots,y_{t=p})=0$ .

We express the τth conditional quantile of response y as:

$$
Q_t(y_t |y_{t=1},\dots,y_{t=p})=c_{(\tau)}+\hat{B_{i(\tau)}} y_{t-i}
$$

Following the approach of @Diebold.2014 , we compute return and volatility connectedness measures based on a quantile variance decomposition.

We represent Equation [(3)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1062940819304085#e0015) as an infinite order vector moving average process:

$$
y_t=\mu_{(\tau)}+\sum_{s=0}^{\infty}A_{s(\tau)}e_{t-s(\tau)}, t=1,\dots.T
$$

where,

```{=tex}
\begin{align*}
\mu{(\tau)}= \frac{c_{\tau}}{\left (I_n-B_{1(\tau)}-\dots-B_{p(\tau)} \right)} \\
A_{s(\tau)}= \begin{cases} 0, s<0 \\ I_n, s=0 \\ B_{1(\tau)}A_{s-1(\tau)}+\dots+B_{p(\tau)}A_{s-p(\tau)}, s>0 \end{cases} \\
\text{and $y_t$ is given by the sum of $e_{t(\tau)}$}
\end{align*}
```
The generalized forecast error variance decomposition (GFEVD),$\theta^h_{i,j}$, is computed as in @Diebold.2014. The GFEVD reflects the contribution of the i^th^ stock return (volatility) to the variance of the forecast error of the stock return (volatility) i^th^ at h-steps ahead and is defined as:

$$
\theta^{(h)}_{j \leftarrow i,(\tau)}= \frac{\sigma_{ii}^{-1}\sum_{l=0}^{h}(e_j^{'}h_h \Omega_{(\tau)} e_j)^2}{\sum_{h=0}^{H-1}(e_i^{'}h_h \Omega_{(\tau)} e_i)}
$$

where, V is the variance matrix of the vector of residuals, $\sigma_{ii}$ is the j^th^ diagonal element of the V matrix, and $e_i$denotes a vector with a value of 1 for the i^th^ element and 0 otherwise.

Its scaled version,$\theta_{j\leftarrow i,(\tau)}^h$ , is represented as:

$$
\theta_{j\leftarrow i,(\tau)}^h=\frac{\theta^{(h)}_{j \leftarrow i,(\tau)}}{\sum_{j=1}^N \theta^{(h)}_{j \leftarrow i,(\tau)}}
$$

The scaled version measures the spillover of the idiosyncratic shock affecting variable i onto variable j [@Ando.2022].

Various spillover measures are estimated at each quantile and are summaries in Table 2

: Table 1: Description of modelling outputs

Table 1 describes the modelling output measurements. The third column describes how these can be interpreted in terms of their network dynamics. Note that, by construction, `own share` and `FROM` sum to one for i=1,2,..,m, buy `TO` can take values greater than or less than one.

The lag order of the quantile VARs is selected based on SIC. It is equal to 1 for the quantile-VAR of return series and 2 for the quantile-VAR of volatility series. As for the forecast horizon (H), we use 10 days. Furthermore, we conduct a time-varying spillover analysis (Diebold and Yilmaz (2014) based on a rolling window of 200 days. To assess the robustness of our results, we use a fixed window length of 200 days and a 5-step forecast horizon and show that our spillover results remain almost the same, suggesting their robustness to the window size and forecast horizon. These results are not reported here but are available on request from the authors. (If needed, I can add these results to Appendix).

# Results

In the context of global defense stocks, we are mostly interested in the nature of network dynamics due to crisis periods and conflict events, which is particularly relevant in the current geopolitical climate. In terms of financial risk management the propagation of idiosyncratic risk contagion is often defined in relation to the difference in the way that the shock propagates during extreme events relative to normal times [@Londono.2019]. Our analysis thus attempts to investigate how much of the uncertainty associated with stock can be attributed to the idiosyncratic shocks coming from stock as the shock size varies.

We present both the return and volatility spillovers across A&D stocks under study. The sample period includes both normal and extreme market conditions, including the Russia-Ukraine war.

## Network topology of return and volatility spillovers

To understand the aggregate spillover intensity among our defence and aerospace stocks we use visualise the results of a full-sample analysis for both returns and volatility at the median, 5th and 95th percentile. These network visualisation represent the strength of the bilateral spillovers by relative thickness of the edges, while the size of each node is proportional to the square root of the total spillover (inwards and outwards) [@Ando.2022]. Finally, the country of origin of the company is represented by colour.

### Return spillovers

Figures 5 - 7 illustrate the network visualization of the static bilateral spillover effects of the 21 return series, while Figures 8 - Figure 10 display the same visualization for the volatility series. Some similar patterns emerge, notably the consistent size of the US stock nodes representing the large aggregate spillover effects in both directions. Raytheon Technology in all plots experiences the largest aggregate spillover effects, indicative of its dominance in the A&D industry. However, there are also some important differences. Firstly, the strongest individual pairwise spillover effects are observed at the median conditional distribution, mostly within countries. Notably, Chinese stocks show the strongest linkages within country but the weakest linkages outside their country of origin, consistent with earlier discussions. In contrast, at the extremes of the return distribution, all pairwise spillover effects are weaker. This finding is consistent with previous studies, which show that in times of stress the network is characterized by a larger number of weaker bilateral linkages resulting in an increase in the weight completeness of the network [@Dungey.2019; @Ando.2022]. In our context, this would mean that while shocks spillovers between individual stocks pairs are small, the overall connectedness of the network is increasing in times of stress, meaning that the shock propagation is higher under extreme return conditions.

### Volatility spillovers

Moving to the network of volatility spillovers, Figures 8-10 exhibit a similar pattern to those for the return spillovers in that the extreme upper quantile is characterized by weak bilateral spillovers and the strongest pairwise spillovers occur at the median quantile. Here we again observe the strongest linkages between Chinese countries, followed by linkages between US companies. Strong linkages between Chinese companies are also apparent at the extreme lower quantile. @huang2021 construct a tail risk spillover network for China's industry sectors. The national defense sector is defined as a 'downstream' sector due to its position in the industrial chain and it is found that it has relatively high volatility compared to other leading industries. @bu2019 analyse movement in the Chinese stock market using a causal network method, finding that in normal period investors are concerned with risk and return but in crisis periods they are only concerned about risk.

## Time varying spillover results

So far, we have analysed measures of connectedness for the entire sample using static network topology visualisation. However, it is important to illustrate meaningful time variation in the topology of both returns and volatility networks of defense stocks under various market conditions. Furthermore, we find that bilateral spillover of idiosyntractic risk are stronger for both returns and volatility systems of defense stocks, which reflect the interconnectedness across A&D stocks. However, it is important to note that restricting the network analysis to the middle of the distribution with this static approach will fail to capture the full extent of dependence when large shocks occur (i.e. under extreme market conditions and events). Therefore in this section, we conduct a rolling analysis with a quantile VAR to capture the time variability in the return spillovers in normal times (i.e. the median of the conditional distribution) and abnormal market conditions (i.e. the upper and lower tails of the conditional distribution). We use a fixed window length of 200[^4] days and a 10-step forecast horizon. This will provide a comprehensive analysis of connectedness at the center and in the left and right tail dependence. This is conducted for both returns and volatility.

[^4]: Existing studies in the Deibold-Yilmaz network literature use windows ranging from 100-250 days. Sensitivity analysis has been done and available upon request.

The TOTAL connectedness index at the conditional median (a measure of the average connectedness) and extremes for returns and volatility systems are presented in Figure 11. In the spirit of Ando, Greenwood-Nimmo, and Shin (2022), the final pair of Figures illustrate the relative tail dependence (RTD) calculated as the difference between the 95th and 5th percentile. Positive (negative) values of RTD indicate stronger (weaker) dependence in the right tail compared to the left tail. For returns, we interpret increases (decreases) in RTD as evidence of a rising (falling) connectedness of financial performance of defense stocks. For volatility, we interpret increases (decreases) in RTD as evidence of rising (falling) connectedness of financial uncertainty in defense stocks, or more succinctly, rising (failing) financial fragility as positive (negative) volatility shocks disseminate through the system of defense stocks

@fig-TCI50 illustrates that in normal conditions the connectedness in the returns system tends to be larger than that of the volatility system of defense stocks. The connectedness reaches its peak at point h (the 'dash for cash' event) at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Importantly, while the connectedness levels are greater in the returns system the volatility system connectedness exhibits higher sensitivity to shocks, with the largest regime shift at point h.

@fig-TCI5 and @fig-TCI95 illustrate the time variation of total system connectivity at the 5th and 95th percentiles of the conditional distributions. It is noted that return system connectedness is persistently high (above 90) at both tails of the conditional distribution, while volatility system connectedness in period of extremely low volatility (5th percentile) is more sensitivity temporal events. The top panel in @fig-TCIrtd illustrates that time variation of the RTD for returns is symmetrical over the period, indicative of equally spread of positive and negative feedback loops in return spillover effects. In contrast, the bottom panel in @fig-TCIrtd shows the persistent one-sidedness of the RTD for the volatility series, with the right tail of the condition distribution dominant throughout the period. This asymmetry suggests that volatility spillovers across defense is amplified by the size of that uncertainty. Taken together, these results suggest that only the total connectedness of defense stocks' volatility is affected by the size of the volatility in the system.

Finally, we consider the chronological order of prominent global economic and conflict turmoil events in the context of median and extreme linkages in the systems of volatility and returns. Some striking patterns emerge in this chronological ordering. Firstly, from the beginning of the conflict in Crimea (a + b) to the Brexit referendum (d) the RTD for volatility trends down, indicative of an increase in resilience (reduction in fragility) in the defense system. This is coupled with the fact that RTD is mostly positive for the return system in this sub-period. Taken together, these findings suggest that upper tail returns (right tail of the conditional distribution) in this period create some spillover effects, while the financial fragility of the system weakens. There is also a notable regime shift at dash for cash date (h) where the financial fragility (the volatility system) fell by 50% (TCI = 40 to TCI = 20).

### Individual connectivity

To disentangle the total connectedness variation further explore the net spillover effects $T_{\cdot \leftarrow i,(\tau)}^h -F_{i \leftarrow \cdot,(\tau)}^h$. @fig-rtnet50 , @fig-rtnet5 and, @fig-rtnet95 present the Net spillover of individual stock returns at the median, lower and upper quantiles respectively. @fig-volnet50 , @fig-volnet5 and, @fig-volnet95 present the same estimates for stock volatilities.

We group these plots by country and some interesting patterns emerge. Firstly, at the median of distributions, the three Chinese defense stocks are net spillover receivers in both their return performance and volatility. This may be indicative of the lack of global maturity in these stocks compared to the other members of the system belonging to developed markets (e.g., US and Europe ). Secondly, the US defense stocks, which dominate the sample, are overall net transmitters of both volatility and return spillover effects. More precisely, in normal periods (i.e. the median of the conditional distribution), Raytheon Technologies and General Dynamics are dominant net transmitters. This pattern also replicates at the extremes of the conditional distributions. While this is unsurprising given that Raytheon Technologies is the largest global defense stock, it is worth noting that General Dynamics is the sixth largest. For the latter, the result can be driven by some large recent defense contracts signed, for example, the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency in March 2022 (US\$4.5 billion), the US Navy in August 2022 (US\$1.4 billion) and the US Army in 2022 (US\$1.2 billion). Compared to the system of returns, the system of volatilities exhibits much more time variation, perhaps indicative of the high sensitivity to market fluctuations of financial risk.

In terms of the prominent dates in Figure 12 and Figure 13, there are notable positive spikes at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic with the largest appearing in the median of the conditional distribution of the volatility system. The largest of these are in Raytheon Technologies and Howmet Aerospace, which both spike at over 200 in net transmission terms. Within the US stocks, Raytheon and General Dynamics are the most transmitive in both their median and extreme spillover effects. Finally, in terms of magnitude, Singapore technology engineering, are the largest receiver of spillover effects at both the median and the extremes, which is not surprising given their small market capitalization compared to the others (see Table 2 for details of size of stocks).

Compared to previous studies, our above findings reveal that both return and volatility spillover measures are not stable over time, and those estimated at normal market conditions (at the middle quantile), intensify during crisis periods such as the COVID-19 outbreak. There is also evidence of intensified spillover effects for return shocks at both lower and upper quantiles, which exceed the return spillover estimated at the middle quantile, thus indicating significantly different behavior across different market conditions. The level of spillovers at the lower quantile in the return system is considerably larger than that in the volatility system, but the level of volatility spillover is extremely high at the upper quantile only and exhibits low variability. Finally , Chinese defense stocks seem segmented from the rest of defense stocks under normal return conditions and moderate volatility state, but they somewhat integrated with global defense stocks under extreme return condition and volatility state.

## Drivers of return and spillovers -- the role of geopolitical risk

In this section, we provide insights on the main drivers of return and volatility spillovers across A&D stocks, while paying special attention to the impact of the geopolitical risk. We run a regression model specified in Equation @eq-reg, using various explanatory variables, selected based on previous studies:

1.  The geopolitical risk (GPR) index of Caldara and Iacoviello (2022), which is constructed based on press articles covering 11 leading international newspapers, and defined as "the kind of risk related to events such as wars, terrorist acts and political tensions, that can affect the normal and peaceful process of international relations" (Caldara and Iacoviello, 2022);
2.  An interaction of GPR with the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian-Ukraine war (), where is a dummy variable taking the value of 1 during the COVID-19 outbreak and war period (January 02, 2020-- July 01, 2022) and 0 otherwise;
3.  The US economic policy uncertainty (US EPU) index of Baker et al. (2016), constructed based on US newspaper articles reflecting uncertainties in US economic policies;
4.  The CBOE VIX index, which captures the 30-day expected volatility of the US stock market and is often used a proxy of fear among investors, not only in the US but across the global stock markets;
5.  The log returns on the S&P 500 Composite Index, which is used as a proxy for the performance of the global stock markets;
6.  The US Treasury spread, computed as "10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Minus 2-Year Treasury Constant Maturity", which reflects the shape of the US yield curve;
7.  The TED spread, computed as the 3-month LIBOR USD rate minus the 3-month US Treasury Bill rate, which captures short-term liquidity risk;
8.  Default spread, computed as the yield on Moody's BAA-rated bonds minus the yield on AAA-rated corporate bonds, reflecting corporate credit conditions;
9.  US business conditions, measured by the Aruoba-Diebold-Scotti (ADS) index of Aruoba et al. (2009), which measures real business conditions on a daily basis;
10. The US inflation expectation, as measured by the 5-Year Breakeven Inflation Rate (T5YIE);

where $TOTAL_t$ is the total spillover index in the system of return or volatility across A&D companies, estimated at the lower, middle, or higher quantiles; $GPR\_{t-1}$ is the lagged value of the geopolitical risk; $GPR_{t-1}.DCOVID$ is the interaction term between GPR and the COVID-19 and Russian-Ukraine war period; $X_{t-1}$ is the vector of the lagged value of control variables, described above, and is the residual term. Except for GPR index, data on the other explanatory variables are collected from Refinitiv DataStream.

We report the estimated coefficients of @eq-reg in @tbl-reg1 for return spillovers and in @tbl-reg2 for volatility spillovers[^5]. Starting with the drivers of the TCI of returns, Table 7 shows that many of the estimated coefficients of explanatory variables are not necessary the same across the middle and upper/lower quantile spillovers. However, GPRindex is a significant driver of return spillovers at all quantiles, and its effect is positive and significant for all cases after controlling for the COVID-19 outbreak period which includes the Russian-Ukraine war sub-period. This suggests that the heightened level of geopolitical risk around the war period has led to an increase in return spillovers across A&D stocks. Regarding the control variables, we notice that S&P500 returns, VIX, default spread, business conditions, exert a positive impact on return spillovers, irrespective of the quantile, bearing in mind that their magnitude is the largest at the middle quantile. In @tbl-reg2, we focus on the results on the drivers of volatility spillovers. The results point to thesame impact of GPR on volatility spillovers, especially when the interaction term is considered, except at the upper quantile. Among the other explanatory variables, we highlight the significant role played by corporate credit conditions, as measured by the default spread, VIX, Ted spread, and business condition.

# Conclusion

This study analyses the return and volatility connectedness of a sample of leading defense and aerospace stocks in normal and extreme market periods using a quantile-based VAR approach of models, the system of connectedness at middle, lower, and upper parts of the conditional distribution of both returns and volatility are covered. Then, the drivers of connectedness are revealed, notably the geopolitical risk index.

The main results suggest evidence of variation in the quantile structure of the system of connectedness among leading aerospace and defense stocks. The network topology analysis reveals that shocks propagate more strongly at both tails of the conditional distribution than at the conditional median, suggesting that the structure of spillovers at both upper and lower tails is dissimilar to that observed at the conditional median. In the tails, the magnitude of bilateral connections is smaller relative to those at the median but they are more apparent. In the latter, connectedness is stronger within countries but the volatility and return systems are less connected overall. Taken together, these results suggest that the evolution of the dependence structure at the tails is notable and should not be overlooked. In other words, it can be masked when connectedness measures are estimated at the conditional median. Accordingly, applying quantile-based models of connectedness is recommended as a natural extension to the pervasive average-based models.

The application of a time-varying analysis shows that the degree of tail-dependence varies with time and intensifies during periods of economic and geopolitical-conflict turmoil. In fact, lower tail dependence is positively correlated with upper tail dependence, suggesting that extreme negative events are associated with an increase in stabilizing lower-tail connectedness coupled with a concurrent increase in destabilizing upper-tail connectedness. Furthermore, the calculation of the relative tail dependence shows evidence of asymmetry between the behaviour of volatility spillovers in lower quantiles and upper quantiles. The findings on extreme connectedness measures in upper and lower tails offer a nuanced view of the importance of tail risk propagation within the network system of defense stocks. They point to the necessity to use the above quantile-based method as part of prudential regulatory and surveillance mechanisms.

An additional analysis reveals the importance of geopolitical risk at the end of the sample period in driving the spillovers of both returns and volatility, without underestimating the significant role played by some macroeconomic and financial variables.

By extending our knowledge regarding the effects of the size and sign of the spillovers on the system of connectedness among leading defense stocks, policymakers can use appropriate policy tools and surveillance mechanisms to manage potential adversative impacts occurring from extreme risk spillovers in the defense and aerospace market. Otherwise, a focus only on the average shocks within the system of connectedness is likely to lead to the formulation and application of inappropriate and insufficient stabilizing policies during extreme events.
